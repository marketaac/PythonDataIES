# Data Processing in Python (JEM207)
The course site for the Data Processing in Python from [IES](http://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/). See information on [SIS](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEM207). The course is taught by [Martin Hronec](mailto:martin.hronec@fsv.cuni.cz) and [Vítek Macháček](mailto:vit.machacek@cerge-ei.cz)

# Course description
The aim of the course is to provide a hands-on experience with the data-manipulation techniques in Python. The special emphasis is put on standard libraries such as *Pandas*, *Numpy* or *Matplotlib* and also collecting web data with *requests* and *BeatifiulSoup*. The students will also be guided through the modern social-coding and open-source technologies such as *GitHub*, *Jupyter* and *Open Data*.

The students will gain their experience using the data from the IES website and subject evaluation protocols.

The course would make use of the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) online sources to provide the students with reliable and yet simple resources for learning Python programming. 

## Learning outcomes
After passing the course, the students will be able to download the data from APIs or directly from the web, pre-process it, analyze it and visualize it.

## Prerequisities
Econometrics II. (JEB110) is an explicit prerequisite for bachelor students.

The course is designed for students that have at least some basic coding experience. It does not need to be very advanced, but they should be aware of concepts such as ` for ` loop ,`if` and `else`,`variable` or `function`.

No knowledge of Python is required for entering the course.

## Final project (70%)
**Description:**
* Students in teams by 2
* The task is to download any data from API or directly from the web. These data should be processed and visualized in the Jupyter Notebook, with auxiliary scripts as .py files. The project should be submitted as a GitHub repository. 
* The selection of the data is entirely up to the students.
* More details during the lecture.

See [an example project](https://github.com/vitekzkytek/Example_Project) from last year.

**Deadlines:**

November 19th: Project Topic First Submission
